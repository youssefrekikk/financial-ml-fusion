Financial ML Fusion
A comprehensive machine learning framework for financial time series forecasting, market regime detection, and automated trading strategy development.

Overview
Financial ML Fusion combines advanced machine learning techniques to analyze financial markets, detect market regimes, and generate trading signals. The project integrates multiple model architectures including Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Time Series Transformers to create a robust prediction system.

Key Features
Market Regime Detection: Identify bull, bear, and neutral market states using optimized Hidden Markov Models
Multi-horizon Forecasting: Predict future price movements with Temporal Fusion Transformers
Signal Generation: Convert predictions into actionable trading signals with confidence metrics
Backtesting Framework: Evaluate strategies with realistic trading conditions (slippage, commission, etc.)
Statistical Validation: Ensure strategy robustness with Monte Carlo simulations and permutation tests
Hyperparameter Optimization: Automated grid search for optimal model configuration
Visualization Tools: Comprehensive visualization of model performance and market regimes
